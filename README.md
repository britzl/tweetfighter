Inspired by real tweets.

You are Donald Trump, who has resorted to handling all official communications through his Twitter feed. Your goal is to last two terms, without making the wrong people angry.

“Are the Tweets real?”

– Some of them, but far from all. You think it’d be obvious which are real and which are fake, but the bluntness and absurdity of many of his tweets is what triggered this game to begin with. For example, take the one where he says [nobody has more respect for women](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/713747213801938946) than he does, the one where he claims global warming [was invented by the Chinese](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385), or why not the one where he in a very presidential manner talks about Bette Midler’s “[ugly face and body](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/262583859709882369)”.
